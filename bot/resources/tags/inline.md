Inline codeblocks look `like this`. To create them you surround text with single backticks, so \`hello\` would become `hello`.

Note that backticks are not quotes, see [this](https://superuser.com/questions/254076/how-do-i-type-the-tick-and-backtick-characters-on-windows/254077#254077) if you are struggling to find the backtick key.

If the wrapped code itself has a backtick, wrap it with two backticks from each side: \`\`back \` tick\`\` would become ``back ` tick``.

For how to make multiline codeblocks see the `!codeblock` tag.
